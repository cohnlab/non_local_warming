The dataset used for this analysis can be found in "https://osf.io/wvr93/?view_only=381e1bde779349e08a74f86c5afc4c07".
The code assumes that the data has been downloaded and saved as "dataset_weights.csv" in the same working directory as the code.

### R scripts to replicate figures:
make\_figure5\_nonlocal.R, make\_figure5\_halo.R  :  replicate Figure 5
make\_figure6.R  : replicates Figure 6
make\_figure_S3.R  : replicates SI Figure 3
make\_figure_S4.R  : replicates SI Figure 4
